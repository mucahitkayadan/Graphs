Graph Algorithms in Java
========================

This project demonstrates various graph algorithms implemented in Java. It includes both Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) implementations, along with functionalities like checking adjacency, finding connected components, spanning tree construction, checking connectivity, and more.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
*   Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) or a text editor for manual compilation

### Running the Project

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    `git clone https://github.com/mucahitkayadan/Graphs.git`.  Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or compile and run it manually.
4.  Execute the `Main` class to run the graph algorithms and view the results.

Graph Algorithms
----------------

The project currently includes the following graph algorithms:

*   Depth-First Search (DFS)
*   Breadth-First Search (BFS)
*   Spanning Tree Construction
*   Checking Adjacency
*   Finding Connected Components
*   Checking Connectivity
*   Detecting Cycles
*   Checking if the Graph is a Tree
*   Checking if the Graph is Bipartite
*   Finding the Length of the Shortest Path

Usage
-----

Modify the `Main` class to suit your specific graph and algorithm requirements. You can customize the adjacency matrix and choose between DFS and BFS by setting the `useDFS` flag in the main method.

    // Enter 0 for DFS or 1 for BFS
